This is Aurora.  It is a super simple article/blog display engine that
is designed to operate as a git repository.  Fire it up, stick in some
content, customize the display, and away you go.

The idea for this software was taken directly from toto:

I loved the idea of a git powered blog, but being the Python guy that
I am (now) it didn't seem right to be running something in Ruby. Also,
Ruby is much harder and slower for me to work with. Therefore, let's
reinvent a bit of that wheel, shall we?

Thus: Aurora.
